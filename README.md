I have figured out how to connect IntelliJ with Github, so it is easy for us both to work on it and see the changes. <br>
  When you open IntelliJ, click '<b>Checkout from version control</b>' and choose '<b>Git</b>'. 
Paste this link in the URL box: https://github.com/AdamTweedie/Adam and click <b>clone</b>. Open the project and edit the files, and when you want to save, click <b>Ctrl+K</b> which will open the commit dialog box. Enter a description of the changes to the file in the comment box. Press <b>Ctrl+Alt+K</b> to '<b>Commit and Push</b>', or click the button with the arrow at the bottom. This should update the file on Github.
